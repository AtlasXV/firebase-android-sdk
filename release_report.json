                "message": "Disconnect from RC real-time server when app is backgrounded. (#5688)\n\nStore the Realtime client's `HttpUrlConnection` reference on the class\r\ninstance so it can used by another client instance method\r\n(`closeRealtimeHttpStream`) to disconnect when the app is backgrounded.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the changes are follow on work to handle network errors\r\nthrown when `HttpUrlConnection#disconnect` is called. Since\r\nHttpUrlConnection enforces a [strict\r\nlifecycle](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/okhttp/+/602d5e4/okhttp/src/main/java/com/squareup/okhttp/internal/http/HttpConnection.java#43)\r\nand this code (1) interacts with the connection in several\r\nmethods/classes and (2) holds open the connection for a long time, it's\r\nlikely randomly disconnecting when backgrounded will occur at an\r\ninopportune lifecycle state.\r\n\r\nThis change inserts a few conditionals to ensure we only call once-only\r\nnetwork methods once, and error handling to catch expected errors when\r\nwe disconnect intentionally.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the code could be refactored to consolidate network handling\r\ninto one class, which would simplify the state that needs to be passed\r\naround and places errors must be handled.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: qdpham <qdpham@google.com>",

Alternatively we could\r\nduplicate this method _within_ `ConfigGetParameterHandler`, but it'd\r\nhave to be `public` which implies other callers should use it (they\r\nshouldn't - there's no other use case besides Rollouts).\r\n\r\nGoogle internal: b/324275156",
